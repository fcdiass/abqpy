class XFEMCrack(Crack):
    """The XFEMCrack object defines the parameters needed to model crack initiation or crack
    growth using XFEM technology. Currently only assembly regions are supported.
    The XFEMCrack object is derived from the Crack object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    suppressed: Boolean
        A Boolean specifying whether the crack is suppressed or not. The default value is OFF.
    name
        A String specifying the repository key.
    crackDomain
        A :py:class:`~abaqus.Region.Region.Region` object specifying the region that contains the crack or is likely to contain
        the crack.
    allowCrackGrowth
        A Boolean specifying whether the crack is allowed to propagate (grow). The default value
        is ON.
    crackLocation
        A :py:class:`~abaqus.Region.Region.Region` object specifying the initial crack location. This parameter is required when
        *allowCrackGrowth*=OFF.
    singularityCalcRadius
        None or a Float specifying the radius from the crack tips within which the elements are
        used for crack singularity calculations. This argument applies only when
        *allowCrackGrowth*=OFF. The default value is None.
    interactionProperty
        A String specifying the name of the ContactProperty object that defines the contact
        properties for the crack surfaces. The default value is an empty string.
    elemId
        A sequence of Ints specifying the labels of the elements that are intersected by the
        initial crack location. This argument is used only by the input file reader.
    nodeId
        A sequence of Ints specifying the position of a node in the corresponding element
        connectivity. This argument is used only by the input file reader.
    hasCrackFront
        A sequence of Ints specifying the values indicating the inclusion/exclusion of the
        *crackFrontDist* values. A zero value indicates that *crackFrontDist* is not specified
        for the ith pair *elemId* and *nodeId*. This argument is used only by the input file
        reader.
    crackPlaneDist
        A sequence of Floats specifying the values of the first signed distance function. This
        argument is used by the input file reader.
    crackFrontDist
        A sequence of Floats specifying the values of the second signed distance function. This
        argument is used only by the input file reader.
    autoDetectValue
        An integer specifying the number of element layers around the crack location, to which
        the crack domain is shrunk.
